  {
    question: 'What kind of systems do you build?',
    answer: 'I specialize in three areas: custom algo trading systems (strategy development, backtesting, live execution), AI agents that automate complex business workflows, and end-to-end business automation that replaces manual processes. Every system is custom-built for your specific needs.',

    question: 'How much can I save with AI cost optimization?',

  {
    question: 'What does a typical engagement look like?',

  {
    question: 'Do you work with businesses outside India?',
